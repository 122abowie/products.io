      <br>Whether you play rock, metal, or fusion, the Schecter Reaper-6 FR is a force to be reckoned with.
      <br>This red-hot axe features a resonant poplar-burl-topped swamp ash body, ensuring maximum natural tone and killer looks.
      <br>High-output Diamond Decimator humbuckers make the Reaper-6 FR the sonic equivalent of a flame thrower but still give you
      <br> enough versatility to cover all of your tonal bases. As for comfort, after experiencing this guitar's sleek body contours,
      <br> Ultra-access Neck Carve, and fast-playing ebony fingerboard, you'll have a hard time putting it down.
      <br>The Reaper-6 FR includes a Floyd Rose 1500 tremolo for rock-solid intonation. Eye-catching black and chrome hardware
      <br>completes the package. This is one Reaper that you'll want to meet. </th>
