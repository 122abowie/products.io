      <br>Ernie Ball Slinky Paradigm Electric guitar strings provide unprecedented strength and longer life while retaining 100%
      <br>Slinky tone and feel. Ernie Ball's industry leading ultra-high strength steel is included in both the wound and plain
      <br>strings along with a patented reinforcement at the ball end twist of each plain string to provide superior tensile
      <br>and fatigue strength for strings that lock into tune fast and hold up under the most stressful playing styles and
      <br>conditions. The coupling of Ernie Ball's Everlast nanotreatment with breakthrough plasma enhanced wrap wire provides
      <br>added corrosion resistance and reduced accumulation of tone-robbing buildup and debris. Experience the first set of longer
      <br> lasting strings that are worth playing with all benefits and no compromises. </th>
