      <h1>Ibanez RG470AHM</h1>
      <br>The Ibanez RG470AHM solidbody electric guitar is purpose-built for high-speed performance.
      <br> It all starts with the RG body style, which is primed for comfort and aggression. The RG470AHM also gives you a
      <br>fast-playing 3-piece maple Wizard III neck to complement its bold-sounding ash body. You'll love how this guitar feels
      <br> as soon as you pick it up. And it sports two Quantum humbuckers plus a single-coil in the middle â€” perfect for rock and
      <br>metal. Get your hands on an Ibanez RG470AHM solidbody electric guitar, and be prepared to be impressed.
