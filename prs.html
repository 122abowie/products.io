    <th>The Custom 24 is the quintessential PRS guitar. This iconic instrument was the first model that Paul Reed Smith brought


      <br>to the public at PRS Guitars’ first Winter NAMM show in 1985 and has been a top seller ever since. Played by internationally
      <br> touring artists, gigging musicians, and aspiring players, the Custom 24 features PRS’s patented Gen III tremolo system and
      <br> PRS 85/15 pickups with volume and tone controls and a 5-way blade switch. 85/15 pickups were personally designed
      <br> by Paul Reed Smith to offer remarkable clarity and extended high and low end.
      <br> The Custom 24 is the original PRS. Since its introduction, it has offered a unique tonal option for serious players and defined PRS tone and playability.</th>
